intro = `
In the IT industry there is certain kind of processes that are rarely executed
without running into a lot of trouble. They are complex, volatile, vaguely
defined and often long-lived. They have many participants and stakeholders. They
are processes like "How to get a new major release out of the door?", "How to
reconfigure the company network?" or "How to build a new datacenter?"

These processes require a huge amount of highly technical knowledge, yet they
are rarely documented. And even when they are the documentation is often
long out of date. The knowledge is passed down by oral tradition. It
gradually dissipates and when people leave the company it is lost forever.

Flowium is an attempt to help with this problem.

It assumes that the process
is written down as a markdown document. Then it turns the document into a tool
to guide people through the process, to track what has already been done, to
collect all the available context and to provide a well-defined communication
channel for all the participants in the process. Last but not least it tries
to encourage updating and maintenance of the original markdown document.

Technically, Flowium is a shim on top of an pre-existing issue tracker, such as
GitHub issue tracker, GitLab issue tracker or similar. It runs entirely in
the user's browser and speaks only to the issue tracker at the backend.
`

shoping = `
Let's start with the most trivial example. A list of items to buy at a grocery.
Here's the markdown document:

\`\`\`
# Bread

Choose a nice, crusty one.

# Butter

Don't buy to much of it else it'll get stale.

# Jam

Either strawberry or raspberry jam.
\`\`\`

You are supposed to upload your document to a source control repository,
however, the examples in this tutorial have already been uploaded for you,
so you can
<a href="index.html?action=create&backend=FlowiumSandbox&template=%2Fshopping-list.md&title=My%20shopping%20list&comment=Go%20shopping!" target="_blank">start shopping straight away</a>.

As you can see you can comment on individual steps and mark them as either
done or not done. When a step is marked as done it's color changes from green
to grey.
`

responsibility = `
Imagine that the user bought both bread and butter and marked the corresponding
steps as done. However, they've left following comment on the last step:
"I hate jam! I am not going to buy it." Then they've closed the issue.

A proper authoritarian tool would require all steps to be marked as done before
the issue could be closed. However, Flowium is lax about that. What's going
on here?

The main design principle behind Flowium is the acceptance of the fact that
complex processes are inherently quirky and full of exceptions. Trying to
enforce the process stricly would just put obstacles in the user's way.
The shopping list may work for most users but once in a while you are going to
run into a user who hates jam and will thus deviate from the process.

Therefore, Flowium adopts a liberal attitude, allowing for arbitrary violations
of the process.

Working with Flowium thus requires a particular mindset. The users have to
understand that the tool is, for better or worse, not going to police them.
It is there to guide, to help with tracking and communication, but it's not
going to hold them back. If they screw up, there's no one else to blame.
`

communication = `
Flowium is, above all, a communication tool. If, after all, there was only
one participant in the process, they could just keep the entire context written
down on a piece of paper and be done with it.

Technically, the entire process is stored as an issue in an issue tracker and
it is therefore accessible to any user with appropriate access rights.

The easiest way to send the issue to a colleague is to pass them the URL from
your browser. When they open it they will see which steps have already been done
(marked grey) and which are still to be done (marked green). They can check
the comments and understand what kinds of obstacles you've encountered when
trying to execute the step.

An alternative way to notify a co-worker is to take advantage of notifications
built into the underlying issue tracker, for instance, GitHub notifications.
If you put someone's GitHub nick into a comment, they'll get notified:

\`\`\`
@johndoe: Can you please take a look at this?
\`\`\`
`

audit = `
Sometimes, when investigating a failure or writing a post-mortem, you want
to see all that happened in chronological order.

Click on the "History" tab in Flowium and you'll get exactly that.

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
Flowium does not allow you to edit or delete comments. Please refrain from
doing so directly in the underlying issues tracker. It may not only obscure
the audit trail but also break the Flowium process.
</div>
`

dependencies = `
More often than not a step cannot be done unless a previous step was finished.

Flowium allows to formalize these dependencies by assigning short names to
individual steps and then defining which step depends on which:

\`\`\`
# Make a toast ~> toast

Insert the bread into the toaster and press the lever. If the toast gets stuck
in the toaster release it by banging on the side of the toaster.

# Spread the butter ~> butter: toast

Don't use too much butter or it will drip from the toast.

# Spread the jam ~> jam: butter

Be generous with jam.
\`\`\`

You can
<a href="index.html?action=create&backend=FlowiumSandbox&template=%2Fmake-a-toast.md&title=My%20toast&comment=Make%20a%20toast!" target="_blank">play with this process here</a>.

The first step has short name \`toast\`, the second one \`butter\` and so on.

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
The short names of the steps can contain letters, digits
and dashes. All the other characters are invalid.
</div>

What comes after colon are the steps that the current step depends on.
For example, \`butter: toast\` means that step \`butter\` should not be executed
before step \`toast\` is done.

<div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
For those familiar with <code>make</code> tool, yes, this is make's syntax.
You can even think of Flowium as of make where individual steps are executed
by human beings rather than by a computer.
</div>

Note that some steps are now colored red. These are the blocked steps, i.e.
steps that have at least one step they are depending on that is not yet done.
That being said, Flowium is liberal and you can mark even a blocked step as
done.

Now that we have dependencies between the steps the "Graph" tab start to make
more sense. It gives you quick overview of the process, the states the
individual steps and what's blocking what. Clicking on a step in the graph will
navigate you the corresponding step.

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
While you may define steps without short names it's preferable not to do that.
If there's no short name, the full title of the step is used as a step
identifier and changing the title can break the workflow.
</div>
`

parallel = `
Especially with long-lived processes, executing all the steps one-by-one would
make the process stretch forever. Instead, we want to execute as many steps as
possible in parallel.

Here's an example of how to do that:

\`\`\`
# Make a decision to build a datacenter ~> decide

Be frank with yourself. Do we **really** need a new datacenter?

Anyway, if we do, notify the procurement to order machines and the
construction dept. to start building the damn thing.

# Build it ~> build: decide

Build the walls first. Then the roof.

# Connect it to the grid ~> grid: build

Plug the cable in.

# Ask for quotes ~> quotes: decide

To order the machines, first ask for quotes from different vendors.

# Select a vendor ~> vendor: quotes

Pick the cheapest one.

# Make sure the machines are delivered in time ~> delivery: vendor

Contact the vendor once in a while to make sure there are no slippages.

# Install the machines ~> install: delivery grid

Machines go to racks. You also have to plug the cables in.

# Flip the switch ~> switch: install

Wait for a stormy night. Then flip the big switch.
\`\`\`

<a href="index.html?action=create&backend=FlowiumSandbox&template=%2Fbuild-a-datacenter.md&title=Build%20datacenter&comment=Build%20a%20new%20one." target="_blank">Play with this process</a>.

<img src="datacenter.png" style="max-width:100%;max-height:100%;"></img>

As can be seen, splitting a flow into parallel flows requires only making
mutliple steps depend on a single one. Joining the flows is done by listing
multiple dependencies for the step.

The important thing to understand here is how parallel flows allow multiple
people to work on the same issue, to share the context, yet be sufficiently
isolated not to interfere each with another. Also, it's important to see how
the delegation of work is done.

Let's consider an example.

Carol the CEO decides to build a new datacenter. She comments on the \`quotes\`
step:

\`\`\`
@patty: Can you please order the machines for the new datacenter?
\`\`\`

Patty the Purchaser gets a GitHub notification and starts the procurement
process.

Carol also comments on the \`build\` step and asks Bob the Builder to start
building the datacenter:

\`\`\`
@bob: Hey, Bob! Can we start building it ASAP?
\`\`\`

Then she marks \`decide\` step as done.

Patty and Bob can now execute their own steps without interfering each with
another. Comments are attached to individual steps and thus Bob doesn't even
have to be aware of what's going on on the procurement side unless, of course,
he choses to have a look at those particular steps.

After they finish their work, both Patty and Bob can comment on the \`install\`
step notifying Igor the Installer that the building or, respectively,
the machines are ready.

Igor takes it from there, installs the machines and finally flips the big
switch to get the entire datacenter alive.
`

variables = `
It is possible to gather arbitrary data from the user.
The data can then be used to customize further steps of the process. This is
especially useful when we want to construct complex content such as
program snippets or command lines. Consider this example:

\`\`\`
# Install Frobnicator

* Which version do you want to install? ~> version
* Which directory do you want to install it to? ~> directory

Execute the following line in your shell:

\`install frobnicator-#{version} --path #{directory}\`

\`\`\`

<a href="index.html?action=create&backend=FlowiumSandbox&template=%2Ffrobnicator.md&title=Install%20Frobnicator" target="_blank">Play with this process</a>.

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
The names of the variables used to collect the input can contain letters, digits
and dashes. All the other characters are invalid.
</div>

<div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
Occasionally, you may want to inspect all the variables collected in the issue.
You may do so by opening the "More" tab, then clicking on
"Inspect the variables" link. You can also change the values of the variables
there.
`

versioning = `
Complex processes are, unsurprisingly, subject to change. The more complex
the process the more likely it is to change.

That can be a problem if the process changes while some of its instances are
still being executed. It's unclear what should happen. Should those in-flight
instances automatically upgrade to the new version of the process? Should they
continue using the old version?

Flowium opts for the latter. When an issue is created with Flowium it is
associated with the newest version of the process. From there on, though,
it sticks with that particular version. If the process is changed it doesn't
effect in-flight issues in any way.

That in turn means that there can be multiple versions of the same process
that are being executed at the same time. For example, one datacenter may be
still being built using the old process, while a more recent construction
follows the new version of the process.

All that being said, user can update the process version manually. Just go
to "More" tab and click on "Update the process" link. Then choose the version to
upgrade to.

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
When upgrading to a new version of the process take caution. Think about
the consequences. If the process had changed a lot, upgrading to a new
version may result in weird behaviour such as steps being done twice or not
at all. Oftentimes, sticking to the old version of the process may be
preferrable to upgrading.

`

backends = `
If, instead of playing with the examples, you go to the
[main Flowium webpage](https://flowium.com), you will be asked to choose a
"backend".

Flowium, as already said, runs entirely in your browser, but the data itself,
be it the process file, the state of the individual steps or your comments,
are stored in a backend such as GitLab repository, GitHub repository or similar.

When you open the main page you see the backends defined for you by
\`flowium.com\`. For example, there's \`FlowiumSandbox\` backend that is used
to run the toy examples in this manual.

However, you are free to define your own backends. Just press one of the
buttons at the bottom of the page and fill in the details.
`

gitea = `
Under construction.
`

github = `
When creating a GitHub backend you'll be asked to fill in the following
information:

* Name: The human-readable name of this backend.
* Client ID: If using \`flowium.com\` use \`d027578d9cca180f9e0e\`. If you are
  self-hosting Flowium, the ID will be different. See the chapter on
  self-hosting.
* Gatekeeper URL: If using \`flowium.com\` use \`https://flowium.herokuapp.com\`.
  If you are self-hosting Flowium, the URL may be different. Check the chapter
  on self-hosting.
* Repository: The GitHub repository to host your process files and the issue
  tracker, in form \`user/project\`.
* Path to process files: Path, within the repository, to the process files
  folder. If the files are hosted at the root level, use \`/\`.
`

gitlab = `
When creating a GitLab backend you'll be asked to fill in the following
information:

* Name: The human-readable name of this backend.
* URL: URL of the GitLab instance. When using GitLab-as-a-service use
  \`https://gitlab.com\`. When using self-hosted instance of GitLab the
  URL will likely be something like \`https://gitlab.example.org\`.
* Application ID: If using \`flowium.com\` use
  \`4dbe6da72b8954701424c1439519d1debe60211f7294547e111787b1e340544b\`.
  If you are self-hosting Flowium, the ID will be different. See the chapter on
  self-hosting.
* Repository: The GitLap project to host your process files and the issue
  tracker, in form \`user/project\`.
* Path to process files: Path, within the project, to the process files
  folder. If the files are hosted at the root level, use \`/\`.
`

issues = `
Once you've chosen your backend you are supposed to choose the issue to work on.

The issues are simply bug tracker issues at the underlying backend. For instance,
if you've chosen a backend that runs on top of GitHub, the issues are bugs in
the GitHub issue tracker for the specified repository.

Flowium GUI gives you an option to choose from recently viewed issues
("Recent" tab). These are tied to the backend. If you choose different backend
you'll see a different set of recent issues.

There's also the "Find" tab which shows all the open issues for the backend.

And finally, there's "Create" tab which allows you to create new issues.
To create you'll need to specify the process file (the markdown file with the
instructions on how to execute the process), the tile and an optional comment.

For example, you may choose process file \`build-a-datacenter.md\` and set
the title to "Build a datacenter in London".

Note that when you have chosen the process file you will sometimes see a short
description of the goal of the process in a blue box beneath the input box.
This is the text from the process file that precedes the first heading:

\`\`\`
This document will guide you through the process of building a new datacenter.

# Make a decision to build a datacenter

...
\`\`\`
 
`

editing = `
Template files (the markdown files with process documentation) are just normal
files stored in GitHub repositories. As such they can be edited and updated
using the standard Git means.

However, it is often less painful to go to the "More" tab and click on
"Edit the template" link. It opens GitHub's online editor, where the file can be
updated and then committed by pressing a single button.

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
Recall that Flowium processes stick to the version of the template file they
were created with. After editing the file you still have to click "Update the
template" link to start using the new version of the process.
</div>
`

selfhosting = `
Flowium runs in the browser and speaks directly to GitHub. There is no
Flowium-specific backend, except for the minimal gatekeeper (see below).
The security tokens are stored in local storage and they are never sent
anywhere.

All in all, the application is reasonably secure.

Still, it requires you to give it GitHub access so that it can create issues
in the GitHub issue tracker. That can, obviously, make you uncomfortable.

If that's the case you can host Flowium yourself. It will still use GitHub
for issue tracking but there will be no third party (namely flowium.com)
involved.

While having to self-host may be a pain, the good news is that even if you
have 1000 employees, you only have to do it once.

What follows are step-by-step instructions to self-host Flowium.

----

##### Create an OAuth application
<br>

On GitHub, go to your profile and select \`Developer Settings\`, then
choose \`OAuth Apps\` tab.

Press \`New OAuth App\` button.

Fill in the form as follows (assuming your GitHub nick is \`acmeinc\`):

\`\`\`
Application name: acmeinc-flowium
Homepage URL: https://acmeinc.github.io/flowium
Authorization callback URL: https://acmeinc.github.io/flowium
\`\`\`

Click on \`Register Application\` button.

In the resulting page find \`Client ID\` and \`Client Secret\` fields.

Note down the values (both should be hexadecimal strings) and store them at
some secure place.

-----

##### Run your own gatekeeper
<br>

Unfortunately, GitHub doesn't allow applications to do entirely without a
backend. The backend can be fairly minimal though, used only to convert
temporary codes issued by GitHub into more permanent security tokens.

Luckily there exists
[vanilla implementation](https://github.com/prose/gatekeeper) of such a backend.

To install it, follow
[the steps here](https://github.com/prose/gatekeeper/blob/development/README.md#deploy-on-heroku).

To keep it simple, you can use their \`Deploy to Heroku\` button to do
a single-click installation hosted on Heroku (for free).

You'll be asked for the application name (set it to \`acmeinc-flowium\`) and
for the client ID and the client sercret which are the values you've got when
registering the application at GitHub.

Wait until the application is fully installed at Heroku, then procceed
to the next step.

-----

##### Fork the repository
<br>

First, go to [Flowium repository at GitHub](https://github.com/sustrik/flowium)
and press \`Fork\` button.

Then delete the \`CNAME\` file in your forked repository to avoid clash
with \`flowium.com\`.

Modify \`config.js\` file like this:

\`\`\`
flowiumConfig = {
    URL: "https://acmeinc.github.io/flowium",
    clientID: "d8ee3245ca4c030b0efe",
    gatekeeperURL: "https://acmeinc-flowium.herokuapp.com"
}
\`\`\`

Where the hexadecimal string is the client ID you've got when registering
the OAuth application.

Commit the changes and push them to GitHub.

-----

##### Publish the website
<br>

On GitHub go to project settings and find \`GitHub Pages\` section.

Select \`master\` branch from the "source" drop-down list.

This should publish you website at \`https://acmeinc.github.io/flowium\`.

-----

##### Test it
<br>

Open \`https://acmeinc.github.io/flowium\` in your browser,  authorize it
to use GitHub and you are ready to go.

To check that everything works as expected you may try to create an issue
based on one of the template files in
[sustrik/flowium-sandbox](https://github.com/sustrik/flowium-sandbox)
repository.
