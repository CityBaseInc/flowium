intro = `
In the IT industry there is certain kind of processes that are rarely executed
without a lot of troubles. They are complex, volatile, often vaguely defined
and sometimes long-lived processes with many participants. They are
processes like "How to get a new major release out of the door?", "How to
reconfigure the company network?" or "How to build a new datacenter?"

These processes require a huge amount of highly technical knowledge, yet they
are rarely documented and even if they are the documentation is often couple
of years out of date. The knowledge is passed down by oral tradition, it
gradually dissipates and when people leave the company it is lost forever.

Flowium is an attempt to help with this problem. It assumes that the process
is written down as a markdown document. Then it turns the document into a tool
to guide people through the process, to track what has already been done, to
collect all the available context and to provide a well-defined communication
channel for all the participants in the process. Last but not least it tries
to encourage updating and maintenance of the original markdown document.

Technically, Flowium is a thin shim on top of GitHub issue tracker. It runs
entirely in the user's browser and speaks only to GitHub at the backend.
`

shoping = `
Let's start with the most trivial example. A list of items to buy at a grocery.
Here's the markdown document:

\`\`\`
# Bread

Choose a nice, crusty one.

# Butter

Don't buy to much of it else it'll get stale.

# Jam

Either strawberry or raspberry jam.
\`\`\`

You are supposed to upload your document to your GitHub repository, however,
the examples in this tutorial have already been uploaded for you, so you can
<a href="index.html?action=create&repository=sustrik%2Fflowium-sandbox&template=%2Fshopping-list.md&title=My%20shopping%20list&comment=Go%20shopping!" target="_blank">start shopping straight away</a>.

As you can see you can comment on individual steps and mark them as either
done or not done. When a step is marked as done it's color changes from green
to grey.
`

responsibility = `
Imagine that the user bought both bread and butter and marked the corresponding
steps as done. However, they've left following comment on the last step:
"I hate jam!" Then they've closed the issue.

A proper authoritarian tool would require all steps to be marked as done before
the issue could be closed. However, Flowium allows to do that. What's going
on here?

The main design principle behind Flowium is that complex processes are
inherently quirky and full of exceptions. Trying to enforce the process stricly
would just put obstacles into the user's way. The shopping list may work for
most users but once in a while you are going to run into a user who hates jam.
Or (too terrible to contemplate!) a user who eats butter and jam without bread.

Therefore, Flowium adopts a liberal attitude, allowing for arbitrary violations
of the process.

Working with Flowium thus requires a particular mindset. The user has to
understand that the tool is, for better or worse, not going to police them.
It is there to guide, to help with tracking and communication, but it's not
going to hold them back. If they screw up, there's no one else to shift the
responsibility to.
`

communication = `
Flowium is, above all, a communication tool. If, after all, there was only
one participant in the process, they could just keep the entire context in
their mind and be done with it.

Technically, the entire process is stored as a GitHub issue and is thus
accessible to any user with appropriate access rights.

The easiest way to send the issue to a colleague is to pass them the URL from
your browser. When they open it they will see which steps were already done
(marked grey) and which are still to be done (marked green). They can check
the comments and understand what kinds of obstacles you've encountered when
trying to execute the step.

An alternative way to notify a co-worker is to take advantage of GitHub
notifications. If you put someone's GitHub nick into a comment, they'll get
notified:

\`\`\`
@johndoe: Can you please take a look at this?
\`\`\`
`

audit = `
Sometimes, when investigating a failure or writing a post-mortem, you want
to see all that happened in chronological order.

Click on the "History" tab in Flowium and you'll get exactly that.

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
Flowium does not allow you to edit or delete comments. Please refrain from
doing so directly via GitHub GUI. It may not only obscure the audit trail but
also break the Flowium process.
</div>
`

dependencies = `
More often than not a step cannot be done unless a previous step was finished.

Flowium allows to formalize these dependencies by assigning short names to
individual steps and then defining which depends on which:

\`\`\`
# Make a toast ~> toast

Insert the bread into the toaster and press the lever. If the toast gets stuck
in the toaster release it by banging on the side of the toaster.

# Spread the butter ~> butter: toast

Don't use too much butter or it will drip from the toast.

# Spread the jam ~> jam: butter

Be generous with jam.
\`\`\`

The first step has short name "toast", the second one "butter" and so on.

What comes after colon are the steps that the current step depends on.
For example, \`butter: toast\` means that step \`butter\` should not be executed
before step \`toast\` is done.

<div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
For those familiar with make tool, yes, this is exactly the same syntax.
You can even think of Flowium as of make where individual steps are executed
by human beings rather than by computer.
</div>

You can
<a href="index.html?action=create&repository=sustrik%2Fflowium-sandbox&template=%2Fmake-a-toast.md&title=My%20toast&comment=Make%20a%20toast!" target="_blank">play with this process here</a>.

Note that some steps are now colored red. These are the blocked steps, i.e.
steps that have at least one step they are depending on that is not yet done.
That being said, Flowium is liberal and you can mark even a blocked step as
done.

Now that we have dependencies between the steps the "Graph" tab start to make
sense. It gives you quick overview of the process, what states the individual
steps are in and what's blocking what. Clicking on a step in the graph will
navigate you the corresponding step.

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
While you may define steps without short names it's preferable not to do so.
If there's no short name, the full title of the step (or rather a hash of it)
is used as a step identifier and changing the title can break the workflow.
